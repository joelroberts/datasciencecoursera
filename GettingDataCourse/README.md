In order to run run_analysis.R the following files must be in the working directory:

X_train.txt
X_test.txt
y_train.txt
y_test.txt
features.txt

Then you can run the script from the command line or interactively.

The result will be a flat text file "averages.txt" with the averages for each feature for each subject id, as described in the associated codebook.
